# Titanic
 
Using some ingenuity and data preprocessing, we will extract some interesting information about the survivors of the Titanic. 
This project explores the various features such as gender, ship cabin, profession, and family size to classify survivors and 
correlate to attributes of survivors and determine factors which were involved to increase survivability. 

**Notable Models:**
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Perceptron (single node neural network)

This is the final project for CMPT310 - Artificial Intelligence Survey
